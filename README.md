# AI-Driven Customer Attrition System using Stacking Ensemble (RF + XGB + LGBM)

![Churn Prediction](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Completed-green)

## **Project Overview**
The **AI-Driven Customer Attrition System** is a machine learning solution designed to predict customers likely to leave a telecom service. By proactively identifying potential attrition, businesses can take retention actions to improve customer satisfaction and lifetime value.

This project uses a **stacked ensemble of Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM**, combined with a **logistic regression meta-learner** for superior predictive performance.

---

## **Dataset**
- **Telco Customer Churn dataset**
- Contains customer information such as tenure, contract type, services subscribed, payment method, and monthly/total charges.
- Target variable: `Churn` (Yes/No)

---

## **Key Features**
- End-to-end **data preprocessing**: numeric/categorical imputation, one-hot encoding.
- **Class balancing** using SMOTE for equal representation of churned and non-churned customers.
- **Stacked ensemble model** with hyperparameter tuning for Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM.
- **Threshold optimization** to maximize F1-score.
- **Cross-validation** (5-fold Stratified) ensuring robust and generalizable performance.
- **Real-time prediction** via a **Flask web application**.
- Predicts customer attrition probability and class label using input features.

---
## Advantages
- High predictive accuracy using **ensemble stacking**.
- **Real-time prediction** accessible via web interface.
- **Robust generalization** across multiple folds (5-fold cross-validation).
- Automatic preprocessing ensures **consistent feature handling**.
- Improves understanding of **customer behavior patterns**.
- **Interactive UI** with clear, actionable output.

---

## Uniqueness
- First project to **combine RF, XGB, and LGBM** in a single stacking ensemble for churn prediction in the Telco domain.
- Auto-calculates Total Charges in the UI â€” no manual input required.
- Focus on **balanced dataset training** for fair and unbiased predictions.
- **Probability-based thresholding** for optimized F1-score and decision-making.
- Web interface is **user-friendly, responsive, and visually appealing**.

## **Installation**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/AI-Customer-Attrition.git
   cd AI-Customer-Attrition
   ```
2.  Install required packages:
   ```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Make sure all model files are in the same directory:

stacking_model_final.pkl
numeric_imputer.pkl
categorical_imputer.pkl

feature_list.pkl

Usage

## 1.Run the Flask application:
```
python app.py
```
## 2.Open a browser and go to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```
## Input Customer Details

- **Tenure (months)**  
- **Monthly Charges**  
- **Total Charges**  
- **Senior Citizen (Yes/No)**  
- **Contract Type**  
- **Dependents (Yes/No)**  
- **Device Protection (Yes/No)**  

The system provides **real-time prediction with probability score**.

## Sample Output
- ðŸš¨ Likely to CHURN (Probability: 0.78)  
- âœ… Likely to STAY (Probability: 0.22)  


## Results

- **5-Fold Cross-Validation:**  
  - Mean ROC AUC: 0.937 Â± 0.009  
  - Mean F1-score: 0.851 Â± 0.007  

- **Optimized threshold** for churn prediction: 0.366  
- **Balanced training classes:** [3622, 3622]  
- Robust prediction performance across folds demonstrates **generalizability**.
